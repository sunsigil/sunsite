		<h2>SOFTWARE RASTERIZER</h2>
		<p>
		A polygon-rasterization renderer written in standard C.
		I have written small libraries for reading/writing BMP images, loading Wavefront OBJ meshes, and performing the linear algebra needed for many basic rendering techniques.
		This renderer makes great use of these libraries of mine, and was written partly to test them out.
		The project is still in-progress, and I am actively working on it.
		Many of the basic concepts and much of the math applied in this project are based on those found in textbooks such as Eric Lengyel's "Foundations of Game Engine Development" series.

		<h2>ECS ENGINE WITH OPENGL</h2>
		<p>
		An old attempt at an ECS-architecture engine. Mesh and texture importing, OpenGL/GLSL rendering.
		Interactibility and basic kinematic physics via entities, components and systems.
		I have dropped this project, but I plan on starting up something similar soon.

		<h2>BMP TOOLS AND TOYS</h2>
		<p>
		To test my BMP library, I wrote a small series of image generation and processing programs.
		Shown here are images from my Kuwahara filtering, Floyd-Steinberg dithering, and Mandelbrot set rendering programs.
		I referenced Wikipedia articles to write these programs.
		As I hear of more interesting image processing techniques, I will likely continue to write programs like these.

		<h2>DEVIL QUELLER: DELONE TRIANGULATION AND R-TREES</h2>
		<p>
		My largest current hobby project is a 3D FPS called Devil Queller.
		I am building it in Unity, but I don't let that stop me from doing lots of experimentation and wheel-reinvention.
		Shortly after getting some basic FPS gameplay going, I began reading about navmeshing to see if I could generate navmeshes for my levels.
		I played around with spatial indexing via R-trees and mesh generation via Delone triangulation.
		In the end, I was pulled away from Devil Queller by schoolwork.
		While I do not have a schedule for completing this game like I usually do, it remains in-progress and I chip away at it when I have the time.

		<h2>CATALOGUE</h2>
		<p>
		Catalogue is a 2D game that I developed solo for my school's game development club.
		In addition to doing all of the design and programming, I made all of the art with ink and paper.
		It's a very imperfect game, but I hope it is an interesting and sometimes delightful one.

		<h2>SCHOOL ART</h2>
		<p>
		My minor is in interdisciplinary design, so I take art and design courses in addition to computer science courses every semester.
		Here is some of the art that I made for my last course, which was focused on drawing for graphic design.
		Three of these are in charcoal, and one is in chalk pastel.
		All were drawn from life, in the graphic design studio.

		<h2>CHAOS GAMES IN PROCESSING</h2>
		<p>
		I used chaos-game techniques to generate some beautiful patterns via the Processing language.
