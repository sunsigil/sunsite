		<h2>SOFTWARE RASTERIZER</h2>
		<p>
		A polygon-rasterization renderer written in standard C.
		All of the calculations that go into rendering are done via my personal linear algebra libary.
		The loading of meshes and drawing of frames is done via my personal OBJ (Waveform) and BMP libraries.
		This project is still in-progress, and I am actively working on it.
		I referenced Dmitry Sokolov's TinyRenderer pages to get the program to its current state.

		<h2>ECS ENGINE WITH OPENGL</h2>
		<p>
		An old attempt at an ECS-architecture engine. Mesh and texture importing, OpenGL/GLSL rendering.
		Interactibility and basic kinematic physics via entities, components and systems.
		I have dropped this project, but I plan on starting up something similar soon.

		<h2>BMP TOOLS AND TOYS</h2>
		<p>
		To test my BMP library, I wrote a small series of image generation and processing programs.
		Shown here are images from my Kuwahara filtering, Floyd-Steinberg dithering, and Mandelbrot set rendering programs.
		I referenced Wikipedia articles to write these programs.
		As I hear of more interesting image processing techniques, I will likely continue to write programs like these.

		<h2>DEVIL QUELLER: DELONE TRIANGULATION AND R-TREES</h2>
		<p>
		My largest current hobby project is a 3D FPS called Devil Queller.
		I am building it in Unity, but I don't let that stop me from doing lots of experimentation and wheel-reinvention.
		Shortly after getting some basic FPS gameplay going, I began reading about navmeshing to see if I could generate navmeshes for my levels.
		I played around with spatial indexing via R-trees and mesh generation via Delone triangulation.
		In the end, I was pulled away from Devil Queller by schoolwork.
		While I do not have a schedule for completing this game like I usually do, it remains in-progress and I chip away at it when I have the time.

		<h2>CATALOGUE</h2>
		<p>
		Catalogue is a 2D game that I developed solo for my school's game development club.
		In addition to doing all of the design and programming, I made all of the art with ink and paper.
		It's a very imperfect game, but I hope it is an interesting and sometimes delightful one.
