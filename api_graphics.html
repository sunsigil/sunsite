		<p>
		I use graphics APIs with C/C++ to build hardware accelerated games, demos, and tools.
		My most used API is OpenGL, with GLFW and GLEW. I've also dabbled with Metal and Vulkan.
		For many tasks, I alternate between writing everything from scratch and using well-reputed libraries.
		Some of my favourites are GLM for mathematics, DearIMGUI for GUI construction, and LibPNG for reading PNGs.
		My real-time games and demos employ a minimal ECS architecture and emphasize speed, simplicity, and modularity.
		I make a point of supporting only the structures that will truly be needed for each game or demo's features so that all code relating to those structures can be appropriately optimized.
		My tools are more oriented around accomodating arbitrary structure. When the needs of projects change rapidly, my tools are able to keep pace.
		My work in graphics APIs naturally has contributed greatly to my shader programming skills.
		In the screenshots below, one can see examples of an "infinite" grid drawn on an unprojected plane, a cube-sampled sky with mathematically constructed moon and stars drawn on a skybox that always occupies the camera's background, and classic Blinn-Phong lighting approximation on textured meshes.
