		<h2>WRITEUP</h2>
		<h3>ATTEMPTED FEATURES</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Basic Pinball Dynamics</li>
			<p>
				This can be seen at many points in the video.
				The first notable instance of balls cascading over each other occurs around 14 seconds into the video.
			</p>
			<li>Multiple Balls Interacting</li>
			<p>
				This can be seen at many points in the video, but it is hard to catch.
				I should have done a better job of spamming ball launches to show it off.
				One of the more ball-on-ball collision-packed sequences occurs around 1 minute and 7 seconds into the video.
			</p>
			<li>Circular Obstacles</li>
			<p>
				This can be seen at many points in the video.
				The first notable instance of balls cascading over each other occurs around 14 seconds into the video.
			</p>
			<li>Polygonal Obstacles</li>
			<p>
				This can be seen at many points in the video.
				Many balls ricochet off of rectangular obstacles around 32 seconds into the video, after level 2 is loaded.
			</p>
			<li>Launcher</li>
			<p>
				This can be seen at every point of the video.
				The launcher is a red triangle whose tip tracks the player's mouse.
				Pressing space launches a ball in the direction of the tip.
				Pressing space causes larger balls to rain from above.
				The rain is not properly related to pinball-style launching, but it is good for showing off collisions and gravity.
			</p>
			<li>Loading Scenes from Files</li>
			<p>
				This can be seen at a few points in the video.
				8 seconds in, the first scene is loaded in from a CSV file.
				26 seconds in, the second scene is loaded from a CSV file.
				47 seconds in, a path not pointing to any scene file is requested for loading and the scene is cleared.
			</p>
			<li>I Dare You to Give Me Extra Credit for This</li>
			<p>
				I did not do any scorekeeping, but I do have plenty of "live" GUI rendering via DearIMGUI.
				I track the number of "living" entities and the current frames per second. Are those types of scores?
				I also have a fun slider that lets you change the timescale! I clamp it between 0 and 1 though.
				One can only allow so much time shenanigans.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<h3>CREDITS</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>GLFW on WINDOW MANAGEMENT</li>
			<li>GLEW on WHATEVER GLEW DOES. EXTENSION MANAGEMENT?</li>
			<li>OpenGL on RENDERING</li>
			<li>GLM on LINEAR ALGEBRA</li>
			<li>DearIMGUI on IMMEDIATE MODE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE</li>
			<li>and CHRISTER ERICSON on SPHERE-AABB OVERLAP TESTING</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>DIFFICULTIES</h3>
		<p>
			The thing I had the most trouble with in this project was definitely collision resolution.
			Detection went about as planned besides a few minor hiccups that were worked out quickly,
			and while getting everything with rendering, interaction, and scene management set up was a lot of work but it was expected work that made sense.
			The first problem with collision resolution was determining the collision point and normal for circle-AABB collision.
			As discussed in class, the case where the circle's center is outside the box is easy. But when the circle's center is inside the box,
			you've got to do some shenanigans with deducing the nearest edge to the circle's center. Once you've got that though, you're all good.
			After that was cleared up, frankly, I suffered from a severe lack of reading the slides. If I had just looked at the formulas for determining
			post-collision velocities more closely both in my own old code and in the slides I would have spent much less time getting my collision
			to look satisfactorily natural. When I was just winging it according to how I thought it should work, there were a few annoying mystery-cases
			where balls would just not act how I knew they should.
