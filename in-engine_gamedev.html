		<p>
		I have been developing games and demos in third-party engines on and off since the start of high school.
		While I most enjoy working in teams as a programmer and have the most experience doing gameplay and graphics programming in engines, due to a mix of passion and necessity I have done plenty of solo work where I filled all game development roles.
		Unity is my go-to third party engine for any real-time game or demo that I need completed quickly, but I have also worked with UE4 and Godot for game jams and personal projects in the past.
		My most recent in-engine gamedev job was developing an educational game for researchers in the College of Design.
		Before that, I did volunteer work developing a canoe carving simulation with the Interactive Visualization Lab.
		To introduce myself to that lab, I also made a 3D painting program which employed Unity's compute shader API for screenspace effects in the GUI and worldspace effects on painted canvases.
		My last purely personal Unity project was Catalogue, a 2D exploration game with shoot-em-up combat.
		Catalogue's art is entirely drawn by hand in ink on paper, and it is animated programatically according to geometric principles.
		Catalogue was a fantastic exercise in writing a framework for GUI that is simultaneously diegetic and non-diegetic, where elements are standard game objects positioned and oriented according to both worldspace and screenspace information.
		After Catalogue, I worked on a 3D first-person shooter to learn about writing my own navmesh generation, since I had only ever done A* pathfinding on pre-existing graphs. I made decent progress on generating Delaunay triangulations and R-Tree spatial hierarchies from walkable geometry, but the game stayed as little more than a demo.
