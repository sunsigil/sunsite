		<h2>ABOUT</h2>
		<p>
		I am a software developer speciailizing in computer graphics who recently received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Interdisciplinary Design from the University of Minnesota.
		Currently, I work for the company Glyphs, developing features for their popular typeface design software by the same name.
		Prior to working for Glyphs, I was a game developer for UMN's College of Design and a real-time simulation programmer for graphics researchers.
		When I was a student, I was an officer for my university's graphics club and for our game development club.
		My primary interest within computing is graphics programming, and my goal is to apply my graphics programming skills to engine development for the games industry.
		As for design: I specialize in typography and game design.
		My big-picture goals are as follows:
		</p>
		<li>to contribute to the development of games that ignite and fuel players' passion for living</li>
		<li>to do design work that improves the lives of everyday people practically and aesthetically</li>
		<li>to uplift my peers as I uplift myself, that we might all contribute to the world together</li>
