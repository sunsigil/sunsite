		<h2>ABOUT</h2>
		<p>
		I am a third-year student majoring in computer science and minoring in interdisciplinary design at the University of Minnesota.
		Currently, I'm helping out with graphics programming and interaction design as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at University of Minnesota's Interactive Visualization lab. 
		Within computing my primary interest is game development, with a focus on graphics programming in particular.
		As for design, I am interested in graphic design, the design of everyday products, and game design.
		I love to cook in my spare time, and I am fascinated by the history and culture that surrounds food across the world. I also love making art.
		My big-picture goals are as follows:
		<li>to make games that ignite and fuel players' passion for living</li>
		<li>to design products and graphics that improve the lives of users practically and aesthetically</li>
		<li>to uplift my peers as I uplift myself, that we might all contribute to the world together</li>
		</p>
