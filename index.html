		<h2>ABOUT</h2>
		<p>
		I am a a third-year student majoring in computer science and minoring in interdisciplinary design at the University of Minnesota.
		I am also an Undergraduate Research Assistant at University of Minnesota's Interactive Visualization lab, where I help out with graphics programming and interaction design.
		Within computing my primary interest is game development, with a focus on graphics programming in particular.
		As for design, I am interested in graphic design, the design of everyday products, and game design.
		I love to cook in my spare time, and I am fascinated by the history and culture that surrounds food across the world. I also love making art.
		My big-picture goals are as follows:
		<li>to make games that ignite and fuel players' passion for living</li>
		<li>to design products and graphics that improve the lives of users practically and aesthetically</li>
		<li>to uplift my peers as I uplift myself, that we might all contribute to the world together</li>
