		<h2>ABOUT</h2>
		<p>
		I am a fourth-year student majoring in computer science and minoring in interdisciplinary design at the University of Minnesota.
		Currently, I'm also doing graphics programming and interaction design as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at University of Minnesota's Interactive Visualization lab. 
		My primary interest within the realm of computing is game development, with a focus on graphics programming in particular.
		As for the realm of design I focus on graphic design, everyday product design, and game design.
		I love to cook in my spare time, and I am fascinated by the history and culture that surrounds food across the world. I also make art when I can.
		My big-picture goals are as follows:
		<li>to contribute to the development of games that ignite and fuel players' passion for living</li>
		<li>to design products and graphics that improve the lives of users practically and aesthetically</li>
		<li>to uplift my peers as I uplift myself, that we might all contribute to the world together</li>
		</p>
