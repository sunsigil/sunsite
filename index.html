		<h2>ABOUT</h2>
		<p>
		I am a software developer specializing in computer graphics. I recently received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Interdisciplinary Design.
		Currently, I am working as a gameplay and engine programmer in Minneapolis. I also do quite a bit of tools development.
		When I was a student, I was an officer for my university's graphics club and for its game development club.
		I also contributed to multiple research projects as a game and simulation developer.
		My primary interest within computing is graphics programming. I aim to apply my skills to develop real-time rendering features for game engines.
		My design speciality is typography. I have professional and educational experience both applying and creating typefaces.
		</p>
		<p>
		My big-picture goals are:
		</p>
		<li>to contribute to the development of games that ignite and fuel players' passion for living</li>
		<li>to do design work that improves lives practically and aesthetically</li>
		</p>
